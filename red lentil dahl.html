    <h3>
      It's creamy, rich, and mildly spiced with a gentle heat from the spices,
      chillis, and ginger.

    <p>
      Dhal is a great midweek meal or alternative homemade Indian curry. It's
      also freezer-friendly and has less than 300 calories per portion.

      As soon as my family mentions wanting a curry, I know exactly what I'll be
      having - dal. There are lots of types of dal, made with various pulses,
      but I love using red lentils - they're quick to cook. and you don't need
      to soak them!

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>

      <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
      <li>1 large yellow onion, chopped small</li>
      <li>5 cloves garlic, minced</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon fresh ginger, peeled and grated</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon garam masala</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon ground turmeric</li>
      <li>1/2 teaspoon red pepper chili flakes</li>
      <li>70 g dried red lentils</li>
      <li>396.89 g can diced tomatoes</li>
      <li>82.72 g can full fat coconut milk</li>
      <li>705 g vegetable broth</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon salt, or to taste</li>
      <li>half a lemon, juiced</li>
      <li>0 g baby spinach</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a large pot or pan over medium heat, saut√© the chopped onion in the
        olive oil for 5 minutes, stirring frequently. Then add the garlic and
        ginger and cook 1 more minute, until fragrant.
      </li>
      <li>
        Add the garam masala, turmeric and red pepper flakes to the pan and stir
        into the onion mixture. Add a few tablespoons of water if the mixture is
        too dry.
      </li>
      <li>
        Now add the dried lentils, canned tomatoes and their juices, coconut
        milk and vegetable broth to the pan. Stir well and turn the heat to
        high. Bring to a boil, then lower heat and simmer for about 15 minutes,
        until the lentils are cooked and soft. Stir occasionally.
      </li>
      <li>
        Squeeze the lemon juice into the pan, and stir in the spinach as well
        until wilted. Add salt to taste. I used 1 teaspoon.
